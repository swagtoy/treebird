                                  TREEBIRD CREDITS

     Without love adieu, this is a project backed by several friends on the Fediverse.

                      Alas, it becomes a social project too...

 * Swagtoy
   Created the Treebird frontend, created mastodont-c (A pleroma C library)
   Originally, this was called RatFE, but the name changed.

 * Grumbulon <@grumbulon@froth.zone>
   Creator of the Logo and the original dark theme

 * Pacific Coast Highway <@pch_xyz@seediqbale.xyz>
   Provided Chinese (Traditional) Translations

 * SamTherapy <@sam@froth.zone>
   Documentation and cleanup, fixed bugs

 * Khan
   Helped with the old Treebird Husky fork (history lesson required)

                             Treebird Linux isn't real.
