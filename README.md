# Treebird

A pleroma frontend for cool people only.

The goal is to create a frontend that's lightweight enough to be viewed without JS, but
usable enough to improve the experience with JS.

Treebird uses C with FCGI, mastodont-c (another library that complements Treebird) for
communication, and plain JavaScript (100% optional).

## Isn't FCGI outdated?

No.
